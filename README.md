### The challenge

![Design preview for the Single-page developer portfolio coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

Build out this single-page portfolio and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

When the user clicks the "Contact me" call-to-action in the hero or projects section, the browser should scroll down to the contact form.
